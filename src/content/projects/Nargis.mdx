# Nargis

Nargis is an AI-powered productivity companion that combines real-time voice chat, task management, journaling, habit tracking, and productivity insights into a single seamless experience. Unlike traditional tools, Nargis is voice-native — you can talk to it naturally, and it updates your tasks, journals, and habits in real time across a web dashboard and synced spreadsheets.

With a unified context engine, edits made via voice, web, or sheets instantly reflect everywhere, creating a single source of truth. Nargis doesn’t just log data — it analyzes it, offering personalized insights, adaptive coaching, and actionable recommendations to improve consistency, focus, and productivity.

This project showcases backend engineering, AIML integration, real-time systems design, and full-stack development. It’s both a personal utility tool and a portfolio-grade demonstration of building a practical, AI-native productivity platform.
