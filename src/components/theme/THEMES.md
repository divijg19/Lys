Portfolio Theme Concepts & Implementation Guide

Theme: Cyberpunk

Core Identity: "Latent Glitch & Neon"

A dark, gritty, and atmospheric corporate dystopia. The environment feels perpetually alive with distant activity, but the foreground interface remains dormant until the user's focus "powers it on," creating localized bursts of light and glitch effects.

Key Components & Effects
Component/Effect	Description	Implementation Details
Primary Background	A dark, procedurally generated cityscape silhouette with atmospheric fog, creating a sense of infinite scale.	src/components/theme/scenes/CyberpunkScene.tsx: The ProceduralCity sub-component uses useMemo to generate building data.
Ambient Neon Signs	Flickering, emissive neon signs in the middle distance that provide ambient light and a sense of life.	src/components/theme/scenes/CyberpunkScene.tsx: The FlickeringSign sub-component uses r3f-drei's <Text> and a useFrame loop.
Post-Processing Glow	A bloom effect that makes all emissive materials (like the neon signs) glow realistically.	src/components/theme/scenes/CyberpunkScene.tsx: Uses <EffectComposer> and <Bloom> from @react-three/postprocessing.
Data Rain Overlay	The signature vertical data rain effect, layered on top of the 3D scene for a rich, multi-layered feel.	src/components/theme/effects/DataRain.tsx: A separate 2D canvas component rendered alongside the 3D scene.
Holographic Tilt (UI Effect)	Project cards lift and tilt in 3D space on hover, revealing a shifting, holographic sheen.	Location: ProjectCard.tsx (or similar). Technology: framer-motion hooks (useMotionValue, useTransform).
Terminal Input (UI Effect)	Buttons flicker with a scanline and cursor effect on click, mimicking a terminal command input.	Location: src/components/ui/Button.tsx. Technology: framer-motion's whileTap prop and custom variants.
Design Principles

UI: Use sharp-edged, retro-futuristic panels. Monospaced fonts are highly encouraged.

Color: A dark base with vibrant, electric accent colors (cyan, magenta, lime green).

Animation: Animations should be fast, sharp, and often incorporate "glitch" or "scanline" motifs.

Theme: Ethereal

Core Identity: "A Placid Dreamscape"

A calm, otherworldly sanctuary that responds gently and magically to the user's touch. The theme is about creating a sense of wonder and turning interaction into a playful, creative act.

Key Components & Effects
Component/Effect	Description	Implementation Details
Primary Background	A vast, light space with a single, slowly flowing, cloth-like entity made of glowing wireframes.	src/components/theme/scenes/EtherealScene.tsx: The FlowingPlane sub-component uses a custom GLSL vertex shader with Perlin noise.
Wisps on Demand	On right-click, the user can generate small, glowing particle wisps that emanate from the cursor and drift away.	src/components/theme/scenes/EtherealScene.tsx: The SceneContent component manages a useState array of Wisp components.
Ripples in the Ether	On left-click, a glowing circular ripple expands outwards from the cursor's position on a 2D plane.	src/components/theme/scenes/EtherealScene.tsx: Uses the dedicated Ripples sub-component, which contains its own custom fragment shader.
Design Principles

UI: Use soft-edged, semi-transparent, and glowing UI elements.

Color: Keep current.

Animation: All motion should be fluid, slow, and organic. Use gentle fades and smooth, easing-based transitions.

Theme: Mirage

Core Identity: "The Unstable Reality"

A crisp, hyper-realistic desert landscape where the stability of reality is an illusion. The world appears perfectly still and sharp until the user interacts with it, causing localized or global visual distortions like heat haze and refraction.

Key Components & Effects
Component/Effect	Description	Implementation Details
Primary Background	A photorealistic desert scene under a hot, hazy sun, created with a procedural skybox.	src/components/theme/scenes/MirageScene.tsx: Uses r3f-drei's <Sky> component and a simple ground plane.
Global Heat Haze	The entire scene shimmers with a subtle, perpetual heat distortion, making the distant view feel unstable.	src/components/theme/effects/HeatHaze.tsx: A custom post-processing effect applied via the <EffectComposer>.
Localized Distortion (UI Effect)	On hover, UI elements like project cards should shimmer intensely or appear to refract the light behind them.	Location: ProjectCard.tsx (or similar). Technology: This would require applying a custom GLSL fragment shader to the card's material on hover.
Design Principles

UI: Use sharp, clear typography and layouts that create a stark contrast with the distorted background.

Color: A palette of desert tones: sand, ochre, dusty orange, and a pale, washed-out blue sky.

Animation: Transitions should be abrupt or jarring. Animate properties like blur, chromatic aberration, or custom shader uniforms to enhance the sense of illusion.
