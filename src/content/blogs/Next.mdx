# My Journey with Next.js, Bun, and React

Building web applications has always fascinated me, and recently, I dove deep into the world of **Next.js**, **Bun**, and **React**. Here’s a summary of my experience and what I learned along the way.

## Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js made it incredibly easy to set up a full-featured React application. The built-in routing, server-side rendering, and API routes helped me focus on building features rather than configuring tools. I especially appreciated the file-based routing and the flexibility to choose between static and dynamic rendering.

## Exploring Bun

I was curious about Bun, the new JavaScript runtime. Switching from Node.js to Bun was straightforward, and I noticed faster install times and improved performance. Bun’s built-in bundler and test runner simplified my workflow, and I enjoyed the speed boost during development.

## React: The Core of My UI

React remains my go-to library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture and hooks make state management and UI updates intuitive. Combining React with Next.js gave me the best of both worlds: a powerful UI library with a robust framework for routing and data fetching.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- **Compatibility:** Some npm packages didn’t work perfectly with Bun, but the ecosystem is improving rapidly.
- **Learning Curve:** Next.js has a lot of features, so it took time to understand SSR, SSG, and API routes.
- **Performance:** Bun’s speed is impressive, but I had to tweak some configurations for optimal results.

## Final Thoughts

Using Next.js, Bun, and React together has been a rewarding experience. I’m excited to see how these tools evolve and continue to shape modern web development. If you’re looking to build fast, scalable web apps, I highly recommend giving them a try!
