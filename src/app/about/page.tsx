        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Hi, I&apos;m Divij. I&apos;m a developer, writer, and systems thinker
        dedicated to crafting integrated digital solutions and building
        collaborative communities.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        With a passion for both the technical and the human side of innovation,
        I work at the intersection of engineering, design, and communication.
        Whether it&apos;s creating seamless user experiences, optimizing systems
        for scalability, or building AI-driven platforms, my focus is always on
        delivering high-quality solutions that meet real-world needs.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        My journey in the tech world has been fueled by a desire for
        self-sufficiency and a drive to help others achieve the same. From my
        early work on personal projects to leading initiatives at organizations
        like AIESEC Brazil, TEDxVIT Bhopal, and GDSC VIT Bhopal, I have
        continually sought ways to combine my technical expertise with my
        passion for community-building and social impact.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        In addition to my work with technologies like the MERN stack, AWS,
        Python, and Rust, I am actively building out a skill-sharing platform
        that leverages the power of cloud technologies and microservices to
        create a decentralized ecosystem for knowledge exchange.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        My long-term vision is to scale businesses that generate meaningful
        impact, while fostering self-sufficient, empowered communities. This
        vision includes creating AI and data-driven tools to automate and
        optimize various industries, improving productivity and quality of life
        across the globe.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Outside of my work, I believe in lifelong learning, always striving to
        deepen my knowledge in areas like data science, AI/ML, game development,
        and DevOps. When I&apos;m not coding or problem-solving, you can find me
        exploring new ideas through writing or working on my personal projects
        to sharpen my skills.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        Whether you are interested in collaboration, mentorship, or simply
        connecting over shared interests, I am always open to meaningful
        conversations. Let&apos;s work together to bring innovative ideas to
        life!
